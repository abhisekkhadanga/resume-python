            <h2>Journey So Far...</h2>
            <p>As luffy's father, Monkey D. Dragon, is one of the most wanted man by World Goverment, he was left with
                his Grand Father Monkey D. Garp. Liffy grew up in Foosha village and met with Shanks when he was only 6.
                Not only Shanks was fond of luffy, he was also impressed by him to the point that he gave him his hat.
                Luffy also ate the Gomu Gomu Devil Fruit at that time. After the incindent with Shanks, which I won't go any
                deeper, Garp moved Luffy to Mt. Colubo to stay with Dadan Family where he met with Ace and later Sabo. Three
                of them trained together and became sworn brothers. Later they got separated to go in their own ways.</p>
    
            <p>At the age of 17 luffy started his journey to become the new Pirate King. He first met with Zoro in
                Shells Town and recruited him. Then he met with Nami in Loguetown first, but Nami was recruited at
                Arlong Park after luffy defeated Arlong. Usopp was recruited at his hometown Syrup Village. Then he went
                on to recuit Sanji in Baratie Ship. Rest of the crew recruitement happened in Grand Line. Chopper was
                recruited from Drum Islands. Similar to Nami, Luffy first met with Robin in Baroque works arc and Robin
                became permanent membre at the end of Alabasta arc after luffy defeated Crocodile. Franky was first
                introduced in Water 7 arc. He joined the crew at the end of Enies Lobby arc. Franky also constructed
                Thousand Sunny after Going Mary was destroyed. Brook was floating in Florian Triangle when he first met with
                Luffy. Luffy defeated Moria to bring back his shadow and he joined Straw Hat Pirates. Lastly Jinbed was
                introduced properly to the audinece in Fish-Man islands. His relation with Straw Hat crew was very complex
                and different fromothers. From being a Sichibukai he became subordinate of Big Mom after Whitebeard was
                defeated. But after meeting with Luffy agreed to join his crew, which he did in Whole Cake islands Arc.</p>
    
            <p>Together Mugibara Pirates have given the one piece many surprises. Their victory over Crocodile, Enel and
                Moria were some of the remarkable battles before timeskip. They wages war against World Goverment in
                Enies Lobby Arc and defeated CP9 in that saga as well. After timeskip their fight in Dressrosa, Whole
                Cake Islands and now in Wano is bringing them fame.</p>
